# Hire View Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The professional summary section was appearing **twice** in the hire view. The root cause was:
- **20240322000001_create_portfolio_tables.sql** created a hero section
- **20241220000001_fix_hire_view_tables.sql** also created a hero section
- This resulted in duplicate entries in the `hire_sections` table

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Sections Removed
Two new migrations were created and executed to clean up the database:

#### Migration 1: `20250101000001_fix_duplicate_hero_section.sql`
- Removes all duplicate hero sections
- Keeps only ONE hero section with the correct structure
- Includes new fields: `profile_photo` and enhanced data

#### Migration 2: `20250102000001_remove_all_duplicate_sections.sql`
- Removes ALL duplicate sections (skills, experience, contact, resume)
- Ensures exactly ONE of each section type exists
- Database now has 5 clean sections total

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Admin Editor
Updated `src/components/admin/HireViewEditor.tsx` to include new customizable fields for the hero section:
- **Professional Bio** - 2-3 sentence description
- **Profile Photo URL** - Direct link to profile image
- **Avatar Text (Fallback)** - Display when photo fails (e.g., "RL")
- **Email** - Contact email address
- **Phone** - Contact phone number
- **Location** - Geographic location

### 3. ✅ Updated Hire View Display
Modified `src/components/hire-view/DynamicHireView.tsx`:
- Now uses `profile_photo` from hero section
- Displays `avatar_text` as fallback
- Renders `bio` prominently
- Shows email, phone, and location from the same source
- All data comes from **hire_sections** table only (single source of truth)

## Database Changes
```
Before:
- Multiple hero sections (duplicates from different migrations)
- Multiple skills, experience, contact, resume sections

After:
✓ hire [hero] - 1
✓ skills - 1
✓ experience - 1
✓ contact - 1
✓ resume - 1
Total: 5 clean sections
```

## Data Source
- **Portfolio Page** (`portfolio-experience.tsx`) → `profiles` table
- **Hire View Page** (`DynamicHireView.tsx`) → `hire_sections` table ✓ (Single source of truth)
- **Admin Panel** (`HireViewEditor.tsx`) → Edits `hire_sections` table ✓

This ensures:
1. No data duplication in hire view
2. Admin panel changes take effect immediately
3. Separate customization for employer and viewer experiences

## New Fields Available in Admin Panel
The hero section in admin panel now has these editable fields:
- Headline
- Tagline
- Professional Bio (NEW)
- Profile Photo URL (NEW)
- Avatar Text/Fallback (NEW)
- Email (NEW)
- Phone (NEW)
- Location (NEW)
- CTA Text

## Testing
✓ All migrations executed successfully
✓ Database verified - no duplicates
✓ Hero section displays only once
✓ New fields are editable from admin panel
✓ Changes are reflected immediately in hire view
